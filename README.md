Ho Ho Ho!
=========
Yes, this is the Advent of Code. It's fun and I wanted to give it a try.

Note that the solution to day 1's puzzle uses the default binary and `day1-input.txt`.
Every other day's uses `src/bin/dayXX.rs` and `src/input/dayXX.rs` for
consistency and niceness.

Please tell me how much my code sucks!
