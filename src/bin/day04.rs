//! Day 4's Advent of Code puzzle
//! =============================
//! Puzzle input consists of pairs of elves and the areas they have been
//! assigned.
//!
//! Part 1
//! ------
//! Find out how many pairs have redundant ranges. These would be pairs where
//! one elf's range is completely contained by the other elf.

use std::io::stdin;

fn main() {
    let lines = stdin().lines();
    let counter = 0;
    for line in lines {
        // 
    }
    println!("The number of poorly planned elf pairs is {}", counter);
}
