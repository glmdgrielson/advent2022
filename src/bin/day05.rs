//! Day 5's Advent of Code puzzle
//! -----------------------------
//! I hate this one already.
//!
//! Puzzle input consists of a diagram of stacks as well as a list of
//! instructions. The actual logic itself is a simple Tower of Hanoi thing.
//! This is just gonna be a parsing headache.

fn main() {
    todo!("Oh holy night, I hate this already.")
