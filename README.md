Ho Ho Ho!
=========
Yes, this is the Advent of Code. It's fun and I wanted to give it a try.

Note that the solution to day 1's puzzle uses the default binary.
Every other day's uses `src/bin/dayXX.rs` for consistency and niceness.
Note that every puzzle expects input from stdin, so pipe in your input file
with `cat` first.

Please tell me how much my code sucks!
